Provides the option to back-up a device record before updating it.  Note this is not a full back-up of all the device attributes but rather attributes we can change; name, asset tag, site, location attributes...  Backups are stored in ~/Library/Application Support/dru/backups and can be dropped back into the app to restore values.

Preview potential changes before committing them.  Attributes that will change are identified by yellow text, blue text identifies a newly added value, and red indicates a value is getting deleted.  To remove the value of an attribute enter a space as the value, leaving the value blank will leave the attribute value unchanged.
